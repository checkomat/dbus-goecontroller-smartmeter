# dbus-goecontroller-smartmeter
dbus service to integrate go-e controller as a grid meter for [Victron Energies Venus OS](https://github.com/victronenergy/venus)

## Purpose
With the scripts in this repo you install, uninstall, restart a service that connects the go-e controller to the VenusOS and GX devices from Victron.

## Based on 
fabian-lauer / dbus-shelly-3em-smartmeter via https://github.com/fabian-lauer/dbus-shelly-3em-smartmeter

### Preconditions
  - go-econtroller with latest firmware 
  - 3-Phase grid
  - Victron Multiplus II and Cerbo GX with Venus OS - Firmware
  - No other devices from Victron Meter connected

### Script
- Runs as a service
- Connects to DBus of the Venus OS `com.victronenergy.grid.http_40`
- After successful DBus connection go-e controller is accessed via REST-API, using the first 3 sensors to calculate real power f√ºr for L1, L2, L3 of the grid
  A sample JSON file from go-econtroller can be found [here](docs/goecontroller-all-sample.json)
- Paths are added to the DBus including some settings like name, etc
- After that a "loop" is started which pulls data every 750ms from the REST-API and updates the values in the DBus

### Pictures

### Get the code
Grap a copy of the main branche and copy them to `/data/dbus-goecontroller-smartmeter`.

The following script should do everything for you:
```
wget https://github.com/checkomat/dbus-goecontroller-smartmeter/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip "dbus-goecontroller-smartmeter-main/*" -d /data
mv /data/dbus-goecontroller-smartmeter-main /data/dbus-goecontroller-smartmeter
rm main.zip
```

### Change config.ini
Within the project there is a file `/data/dbus-goecontroller-smartmeter/config.ini` - just change the values - most important is the host, username and password in section "ONPREMISE". More details below:

| Section  | Config vlaue | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| DEFAULT  | SignOfLifeLog  | Time in minutes how often a status is added to the log-file `current.log` with log-level INFO |
| DEFAULT  | CustomName  | Name of your device - usefull if you want to run multiple versions of the script |
| DEFAULT  | DeviceInstance  | DeviceInstanceNumber e.g. 40 |
| DEFAULT  | LogLevel  | Define the level of logging - lookup: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#levels |
| ONPREMISE  | Host | IP or hostname of the go-e controller |
| ONPREMISE  | Serial | Serialnumber of the go-e controller |

### Install

chmod a+x /data/dbus-goecontroller-smartmeter/install.sh
